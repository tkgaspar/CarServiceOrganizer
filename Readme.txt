t is my first own project, to showcase technologies learned at Udacity's Java Web Development course. A Java - Spring MVC application, using Thymeleaf to interact with the frontend, JPA-Hibernate for an ORM, MySQL for database. HTML,CSS,Bootstrap used and transformed in this project is borrowed from Udacity course material. Application is meant to organize and record activities in a car service, a registered user can launch a repair request, that is accepted and scheduled for repair by a scheduler (ADMIN or EDITOR) on the service side. Each User can see his/her own requests, as feedback on it's state, Admin can see all requests, can assign roles, manage requests.  Under construction.
User submits a reparation request, with car and issue details, request gets into a list of requests, 
where p&a consultant can confirm parts ordered for the vehicle, organizer can assign a mechanic/electrician 
and a timeframe for the operation.
